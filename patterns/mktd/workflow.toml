## Instructions
Each item is a [ ] checkbox with executor tag.
Write all TODO descriptions, section headers, and task names in ${USER_LANGUAGE}.
Technical terms, code snippets, commit scope strings, and executor tags remain in English.
If USER_LANGUAGE is empty or unset, default to the language used in the FEATURE description.
Pre-assign executors: [Main], [Sub:developer], [Skill:commit], [CSA:tool].

## Output
Output the COMPLETE TODO plan as text to stdout.
Do NOT write files to the project directory.
The output will be captured as ${STEP_4_OUTPUT} for subsequent steps."""

- Incorrect task ordering
- Unrealistic scope or missing edge cases
- Security risks not addressed
- Tasks that should be split or combined
